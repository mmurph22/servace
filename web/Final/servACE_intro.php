					<h4>Volunteers Benefit the Community and Themselves</h4>
					<blockquote cite="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/volunteering-and-its-surprising-benefits.htm">
						Volunteering offers vital help to people in need, worthwhile causes, and the community, but the benefits can be even greater for you, the volunteer. Volunteering and helping others can help you reduce stress, combat depression, keep you mentally stimulated, and provide a sense of purpose. While it’s true that the more you volunteer, the more benefits you’ll experience, volunteering doesn’t have to involve a long-term commitment or take a huge amount of time out of your busy day. Giving in even simple ways can help others those in need and improve your health and happiness.
